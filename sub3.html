            <p class="lead">Easy reader books are for children just starting
                to read on their own (age 6-8), and have illustrations on every page like a picture book.

                The length varies greatly by publisher; the books can be 32-64 pages long, with 200-1500 words of text,
                occasionally going up to 2000 words. The stories are told mainly through action and dialogue, in
                grammatically simple sentences (one idea per sentence). Books average 2-5 sentences per page. </p>

                        <h2>Penny and Her Marble</h2>
                        <h4>by Kevin Hankes</h4>
                        <p>
                            Caldecott Medalist Kevin Henkes’s award-winning Penny returns in the third I Can Read story
                            about a sweet and curious mouse, perfect for fans of Lilly’s Purple Plastic Purse, Owen, and
                            Chrysanthemum.

                            When Penny spots a marble in Mrs. Goodwin's front yard, she picks it up, puts it in her
                            pocket, and takes it home. It's a beautiful marble—it's big, shiny, blue, smooth, and fast,
                            and Penny loves it. But does the marble really belong to Penny?

                            Penny and Her Marble was named a 2014 Geisel Honor book by the American Library Association.
                            This annual award, given to the most distinguished books for beginning readers, is named for
                            the world-renowned children's author Theodor Geisel, also known as Dr. Seuss.

                            Kevin Henkes is a master at creating beautifully illustrated books that resonate with young
                            children. The Penny books are new classics for beginning readers and will appeal to fans of
                            Frog and Toad, Little Bear, and Henry and Mudge. Penny and Her Marble is a Level One I Can
                            Read book, which means it's perfect for children learning to sound out words and sentences.
                            Whether shared at home or in a classroom, the short sentences, familiar words, and simple
                            concepts of Level One books support success for children eager to start reading on their
                            own.

                            Don't miss Penny's newest adventures in Penny and Her Sled!
